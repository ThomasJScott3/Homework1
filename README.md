# TITLE: Profile of the Stash Investing App

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company: 

-Stash Capital LLC

* When was the company incorporated? 

-The company was founded in February 2015. It is based in New York City.

*Who are the founders of the company? 

-The company was founded by Brandon Krieg, David Ronick, and Ed Robinson. Krieg and Robinson both worked on Wall Street before leaving their six-figure positions
to found stash in 2015.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

-The company was inteded to target millenials, but has since broadened its reach.
According to Krieg, the main idea is to adddress "the lack of financial security is a rapidly escalating issue in the U.S. Stash's goal since day one
has been to help the masses of underserved Americans jump start their journey towards building a healthy and prosperous future." This service is particularly relevant
given that 63% of Americans have less than $500 in their bank account to cover for an emergency expense. The app also fills another void: roughly half of Americans
have no assets in the stock market. The retirement and wealth-building implications of this are frightening to say the least. Stash hopes to remedy this disparity with
access to a diverse array of ETFs, individual stocks as well as custodial accounts and even life insurance. In essence, they seek to bridge the investment gap through
enhanced access to retail banking and investment as well as crucial information for entry level users.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

-The company has been through multiple rounds of capital raising. The first was on it's 3 year anniversary in February 2018. This attempt raised $37.5 million. 
The next attempt was in April 2020. This most recent attempt raised $112 million. The first round of funding was class D, whereas the second round was class F. 
The first round of class D funding was lead by a venture capital firm based out of New York called Union Square Ventures. Said firm has a total of $1 billion in assets
under management. Although Union Square helped acquire funding for the first round, it did not neccessarily stick around for the second round of funding. The second
round of class F funding was actually supervised by LendingTree. LendingTree is widely advertised to consumers as a one-stop-shop for financial products. The site
has everything from consumer loans, credit consolidation loans, mortgages and insurance. It is a publicly traded company and is listed on the NASDAQ. In addition,
LendingTree is headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
In addition, the company charges a $1 a month fee for users with brokerage assets under $5,000. For users who have a greater amount invested with stash, the company
charges a per anum fee of 0.25 percent of assets under management. So there is an incentive for retail investors not to let their brokerage account balance exceed that
baseline amount. 

## Business Activities:

*What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

-Stash was started as a commision free retail investment platform meant to prioritize long-term investments. 
It allows users to select from a wide range of assets. These include, but are not limited to ETFs as well as individual securities. The point of the app is to make 
investing more accessible. When questioned on the intent behind their creation, the founders lamented the inaccessability and confusing nature of investing. 
The founders essentially did an informal straw poll of the public to determine this. One of the main answers that they got back was that people were confused 
or thought that investing required a great deal of money. So the problem is two-fold. The first element is that to few members of the public are investing and the second
is that the information that is available is confusing, overly technical and generaly inaccessible to the man or woman on the street. Stash addresses this through
the strategic implementation of rudimentary AI and practical design and UI. The app's algorithms get a sense of where the user is financially as well as where the 
user wants to be and helps them set target goals for account growth and diversification. 

The app is also helpful with regard to people who are "unbanked." That is a contemporary euphamism for those in the past would not have been able to open an account
with a brick and mortar financial institution. Stash works with Green Dot bank in order for users to make deposits into their brokerage accounts. The green dot account
is a checking account and as such users can set up direct deposit with their employers if they wish. When they sign up for the checking account, stash sends the users
a debit card to make purchases. In addition, some qualifying purchases are eligible for Stash's "stock-back" rewards program. Under this program, users actually get a
small fractional share of the company he or she made a purchase from. In my case, I put all my streaming service subscriptions with this account. As such, I get a few 
cents back every month which is automatically reinvested in my portfolio. This is very advantageous for consumers who want the benefits of credit card rewards programs,
but are averse to the slippery slope of revolving credit lines.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

-The intended custmer of Stash are inexperienced retail investors. The main target are those who have small amounts of money that they wish to grow over time. Interviews
with the founders indicate that the primary target demographic are millenials. The millenial generation and their generation Z counterparts now outnumber the baby boom
generation in terms of size. One thing that the founders mentioned is that their target audience does not being told what to do. Studies show that millenials value flexibility.
As such, stash users can pick from a variety of investment options in a user friendly manner. Let's contrast this with my retirement investment manager Fidelity. 
Fidelity has a very stringent set of funds to pick from. In my case, I consulted a human financial advisor who helped select the correct funds to invest in. The reason
that I reached out to a real person was because of the disoriented way in which information was laid out. In stash, the graphs, charts and general information is simplified.
The closest thing fidelity's 401k web interface has to a robo advisor or automatic balancing is a target year fund. This is essentially a generic mix of stocks and bonds
assembled by professional asset managers based on when a given worker is set to retire. I opted out of this mix myself after consulting with my own financial advisor.
In the case of stash however, the human element is taken out of the mix. This is great news for millenials living paycheck to paycheck because they save time and money that
they would otherwise have spent talking to humans, investigating complex fund prospecti and possibly paying brokerage fees.

*What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

-Unlike Robinhood, which is their primary rival in the millenial-generation Z retail investment space, Stash offers a wide range of services aside from commission-free
securities and cryptocurrency trading. Among these other services is access to custodial accounts, insurance products and portfolio diversification analysis. The app
also has a built in robo advisor. Robinhood does not have this function. he robo advisor function, which the company refers to as "stash advisor." The user has to input
various factors such as their age and risk factor. From there, the app's robo advisor gives investment suggestions based on a curated list of ETFs. The key advantage
that stash is able to leverage is bundling of services. They offer wrap-around banking and insurance services, which when combined with their learning and gamification
features offers users a powerful tool for personal finance as well as overall financial literacy.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

-Gamification is a key feature. However, more generally the core strength of stash's software implementation lies in it's user interface.

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
-Stash is part of a key sector in the FinTech space. It spans both retail investing as well as the burgeoning field of robo advisors. Robo advisors have emerged over
the last decade as a key bridge between new investors and the brokerage space. The use of robo advisors does pose some regulatory questions, however, these are dwarfed
by the potential benefits to consumers. Robo advisors allow brokers the ability to gather crucial information from retail investors regarding

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
-Mobile technology has been crucial to the growth of this domain over the past decade.

* What are the other major companies in this domain?
-At this juncture, Stash's primary competitors are RobinHood and Acorns. RobinHood, like Stash offers commission free trading combined with a user-friendly mobile
interface. There is also M1 Finance, which allows users to purchase fractional shares of a stock. With regard to Acorns, Stash has an advantage in that it includes
a banking element. The ability to invest in fractional shares allows retail investors to dollar cost average their investments. This means that when he or she invests
they do so by investing a fixed dollar amount over time. Acorns is also very good in this regard. However, their main draw is that they allow users to round up their
purchases to the nearest dollar amount. Interestingly enough, Stash actually has a similar feature. Stash has a "stock back" feature which rounds up purchases on the
user's stash debit card and then provides a small fractional share as cash back.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
-The company has over 5 million users so far. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
-By their own assertion, the people behind Stash think things are going swimingly. The indicators of success that they note in their blog are the ever-expanding features.
They boast faster access to funds as well as a larger selection of ETFs and other assets.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
-Stash is actually behind the pack in terms of users and subscribers. RobinHood as 13 million users and Acorns has roughly 8.5 million users.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

-I would offer call options. I think RobinHood allows users too much leeway with options and leverage generally, but I think that offering call options which would allow
users to go long on certain stocks would be highly beneficial. For example, I bought options contracts for Lloyd's and made a small profit on them. With the right education
and financial tools users could conceivably have similar outcomes. The key, I believe, will be the integration of AI and machine learning to conduct technical analysis
review market and media sentiment and put all of this information in front of the app. In this way, the user of the app will be able to make an informed decision with 
regards to options trading, which is in itself a highly risky endeavor.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
-I think that options, when done correctly are a great way to grow one's portfolio. However, I think they need to be paired with a robust educational tool so that potential
users know what it is that they are getting into. Furthermore, I think stash as a brokerage is almost too passive. For this reason, I think that adding options will
actually bring users onto the app more frequently. That being said, use of options in any context bears a great deal of risk. There have been instances where RobinHood
users have actually committed suicide because there options yielded negative equity and they were underwater in the tens of thousands of dollars. In order to prevent this
outcome, perhaps a fail-safe can be added. I suggest a cap on the overall dollar amount that brokerage could take out in options contracts on the user's behalf. Overall,
the use of call options only in addition to having a cap would greatly reduce the risk posed to retail investors in these types of transactions.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
-None that already do not already exist. Essentially the main hurdle will be optimizing UI. In my humble opinion, the key features can be cloned from RobinHood. One thing to
keep in mind is software patents. The cloning of the feature from RobinHood would have to implement reverse-engineered software that is different enough from RobinHood's
to keep the litigators at bay. The software at the front-end would also need to sync up with the brokerage services on the backend. Essentially there needs to be a clean
full-stack implementation in order for the feature to work. From there, stash would probably need to carry out QA as well as beta testing in order to debug the feature
prior to roll out.

*Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
-These technologies are both neccessary and essential to implement the solution in question. Without effective UI there would be no app. The difference between the UI
for an app like Stash and something like Fidelity is almost striking. As mentioned in prior sections, effective UI that is simple and user-friendly is crucial. Fidelity
has the market share and book of business to be competitive in this realm whereas Stash is up-and-coming in this regard. In this way, Stash can't afford to alienate potential
users with unattractive UI. Another key element is reverse engineering. This part is appropriate in cases where key innovations can't be created independently. 
To be frank, it is also a shortcut.
